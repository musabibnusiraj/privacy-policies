# Privacy Policy for SuccessCall

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

Thank you for choosing SuccessCall ("we," "us," "our"). This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it. This policy applies to our mobile application, SuccessCall (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

SuccessCall requires access to your device's location to provide its core functionality.

*   **Why we need it:** Your geographic location (latitude and longitude) is used to accurately calculate Islamic prayer times (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and determine the Qibla direction.
*   **How we use it:** This location data is used locally on your device only. It is **not** stored, saved on any server, or shared with any third party. The calculation happens entirely on your device.

### Personal Information

We do not collect any personally identifiable information. You can use SuccessCall without creating an account or providing any personal data like your name, email address, or phone number.

### Usage Data (Analytics)

To help us improve the App, we may collect anonymous, non-personal usage data. This may include information like crash reports, app performance data, and which features are used most often. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely for the following purposes:

*   To provide and maintain the core features of the App, such as displaying accurate prayer times and sending prayer notifications.
*   To understand and analyze how you use our App so we can improve its functionality, performance, and user experience.
*   To ensure the stability of the App and fix crashes.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We respect your privacy. We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information or location data with any third-party companies, organizations, or individuals for any purpose, including marketing or advertising.

The only exception would be in response to a legal obligation, such as a court order or government request, if we are required to do so by law.

## Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. Since location data is processed only on your device and not stored, the risk of a remote data breach is minimized. We take reasonable measures to protect the anonymous usage data we collect.

## Children's Privacy

Our App is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove it.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
