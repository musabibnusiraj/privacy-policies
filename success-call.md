# Privacy Policy for SuccessCall

**Last Updated:** November 23, 2025

Thank you for choosing SuccessCall ("we," "us," "our"). This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage it. This policy applies to our mobile application, SuccessCall (the "App").

## Information We Collect

### Location Data

SuccessCall **does not** collect, access, or use your device's location data.

*   **How prayer times work:** The app uses a zone-based system where you manually select your prayer zone from predefined areas in Sri Lanka (Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Mannar, and Puttalam districts). Prayer times are calculated based on your selected zone, not your GPS location.
*   **No GPS required:** Your selection is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted anywhere.

### Personal Information

We do not collect any personally identifiable information. You can use SuccessCall without creating an account or providing any personal data like your name, email address, or phone number.

### App Preferences and Settings

The app stores your preferences locally on your device using secure local storage. This includes:
*   Selected prayer zone (Zone1-Zone4)
*   Selected mosque for prayer time adjustments
*   Prayer notification preferences
*   Iqamah time adjustments for each prayer
*   Display preferences (theme, language, clock style)

This data is stored only on your device and is never sent to any server or third party.

## How We Use Your Information

Your locally stored preferences are used solely for the following purposes:

*   To provide and maintain the core features of the App, such as displaying accurate prayer times based on your selected zone and sending prayer notifications.
*   To remember your preferences (zone selection, mosque, iqamah times, theme, language) between app sessions.
*   To customize your prayer notifications according to your preferences.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We respect your privacy. Since all data is stored only on your device, we have no data to share, sell, or trade.

*   **No data transmission:** Your preferences and settings never leave your device.
*   **No third-party services:** We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
*   **No servers:** The app does not connect to any backend servers or cloud services.

## Data Security

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Since all your preferences are stored only on your device using Flutter's secure local storage (SharedPreferences), and no data is transmitted over the network:

*   There is no risk of a remote data breach.
*   Your data is protected by your device's security measures.
*   Uninstalling the app will remove all stored preferences from your device.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

*   **Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS):** Required to send you prayer time reminders and notifications. You can disable notifications at any time in the app settings or your device settings.

The app does **not** request or use:
*   Location permissions
*   Camera or microphone access
*   Contact list access
*   Storage permissions (beyond standard app data)
*   Internet access (the app works fully offline)

## Children's Privacy

Our App is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, there are no privacy concerns specific to children. The app can be safely used by anyone.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
